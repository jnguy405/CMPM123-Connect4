# CMPM123 Connect 4

## Overview

My Connect 4 implementation features an AI opponent using negamax algorithm for decision-making, and support for human vs human, human vs AI, and AI vs AI gameplay modes. The game detects horizontal, vertical, and diagonal winning conditions using directional helper methods from the Grid class, with comprehensive logging of all game states and moves.
